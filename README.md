# Track Pack  
	Long Range Wi-Fi

## Freshman Engineering Design Project  

### Description
The NodeJS Server receives the user's location using a smartphone GPS sent via an HTTP GET request through the Tasker app.  
The Arduino Client receives the location from the NodeJS Server as well as it's own GPS Location.  
The Arduino Client then uses a Magnetometer and Trig to rotate the wifi disk towards the user.
